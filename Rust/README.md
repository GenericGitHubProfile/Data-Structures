Rust was chosen as the next language to learn due to it's energy efficiency (as seen in paper DOI:10.1145/3136014.3136031).

As well as this it has massively reduced memory usage and better speed compared to higher level languages like python and javascript, even beating out stronger languages such as C# and is competative with C++

This means that Rust will be a good language to learn as it will put less strain on machines running it and require less budget to continue operation.
